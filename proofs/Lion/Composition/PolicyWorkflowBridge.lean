BRIDGE THEOREMS: Connecting Policy/Workflow Track with Composition Track

Gap Analysis Summary (from composition_integration.md):
- Track A: SystemInvariant → PolicySound → policy_denied_no_auth
- Track B: WorkflowExecutionSafe → WorkflowPolicyCompliant → TaskAuthorizable
- This file BRIDGES Track A and Track B

Design Philosophy:
- Bridge theorems show relationships, not duplications
- Each bridge has clear direction: what it derives FROM and TO
- Proofs use existing infrastructure rather than reinventing

Key Bridges:
1. PolicySound <-> WorkflowPolicyCompliant (bidirectional connection)
2. SystemInvariant preservation through workflow execution
3. ComponentSafe extension for policy compliance (ComponentPolicySafe)
4. Full integration: SystemInvariant + AllWorkflowsAuthorized => SystemSecure

/-! =========== BRIDGE 1: PolicySound <-> WorkflowPolicyCompliant =========== -/

section PolicyWorkflowBridge

/-
**Gap Being Bridged**:
- PolicySound says: if policy denies, no authorization exists
- WorkflowPolicyCompliant says: all pending tasks can be authorized
- These are NOT equivalent, but connected

**Key Insight**:
PolicySound is a NEGATIVE condition (denies block authorization)
WorkflowPolicyCompliant is a POSITIVE condition (authorizations exist)

The bridge shows: PolicySound is NECESSARY but not SUFFICIENT for compliance.
We need both PolicySound + capability availability.
-/

/--
**AllTasksHaveCapabilities**: Each pending task in a workflow has
at least one valid capability that could authorize it.

This is the CAPABILITY AVAILABILITY predicate that, combined with
PolicySound, enables WorkflowPolicyCompliant.

Note: This does NOT check policy - just capability existence.
-/
def AllTasksHaveCapabilities (s : State) (wi : WorkflowInstance)
    (binding : WorkflowTaskBinding) : Prop :=
  ∀ n : Nat, n ∈ wi.definition.nodes →
    wi.node_states n = .pending →
    ∃ task : WorkflowTask, binding n = some task ∧
      ∃ cap : Capability, s.kernel.revocation.caps.get? cap.id = some cap ∧
        cap.holder = task.action.subject ∧
        cap.target = task.action.target ∧
        task.action.rights ⊆ cap.rights ∧
        cap_isValid s cap ∧
        cap.id ∈ (s.plugins task.plugin).heldCaps ∧
        cap.id ∈ (s.plugins task.action.subject).heldCaps

/--
**AllTasksPolicyPermits**: Policy permits all pending tasks in a workflow.

This is the POLICY PERMIT predicate that checks the positive side.
-/
def AllTasksPolicyPermits (s : State) (wi : WorkflowInstance)
    (binding : WorkflowTaskBinding) (ctx : PolicyContext) : Prop :=
  ∀ n : Nat, n ∈ wi.definition.nodes →
    wi.node_states n = .pending →
    ∃ task : WorkflowTask, binding n = some task ∧
      policy_check s.kernel.policy task.action ctx = .permit

/--
**Bridge Theorem 1.1: Capabilities + Policy Permits => WorkflowPolicyCompliant**

This is the FORWARD bridge: if we have capabilities AND policy permits,
then the workflow is policy-compliant.

Proof sketch: Unpack the two predicates and construct TaskAuthorizable
from the capability that exists and the policy permit.
-/
theorem caps_and_policy_imply_workflow_compliant
    (s : State) (wi : WorkflowInstance)
    (binding : WorkflowTaskBinding) (ctx : PolicyContext)

    WorkflowPolicyCompliant s wi binding ctx := by
  intro n h_in h_pending
  -- Get capability from h_caps (now uses cap.id consistently)
  obtain ⟨task, h_binding, cap, h_get, h_holder, h_target, h_rights, h_valid, h_held, h_cap_held⟩ :=

    exact ⟨h_holder, h_target, h_rights, h_valid, h_cap_held⟩

/--
**Bridge Theorem 1.2: WorkflowPolicyCompliant => AllTasksPolicyPermits**

This is the BACKWARD bridge (partial): if workflow is compliant,
then policy must permit all tasks.

Proof: Extract the policy permit from TaskAuthorizable/authorize.
-/
theorem workflow_compliant_implies_policy_permits
    (s : State) (wi : WorkflowInstance)
    (binding : WorkflowTaskBinding) (ctx : PolicyContext)
    (h_compliant : WorkflowPolicyCompliant s wi binding ctx) :
    AllTasksPolicyPermits s wi binding ctx := by
  intro n h_in h_pending
  obtain ⟨auth, _⟩ := h_compliant n h_in h_pending
  refine ⟨auth.task, auth.h_binding, ?_⟩
  -- Extract policy permit from TaskAuthorizable
  obtain ⟨capId, _h_held, cap, _h_get, h_auth⟩ := auth.h_authorizable
  unfold authorize at h_auth
  exact h_auth.1

/--
**Bridge Theorem 1.3: PolicySound + WorkflowPolicyCompliant are COMPATIBLE**

If SystemInvariant holds (including PolicySound), then a workflow can still
be policy-compliant - PolicySound does not prevent compliance.

This is the KEY consistency check: the two tracks are not contradictory.
-/
theorem policySound_compatible_with_workflowCompliant
    (s : State) (wi : WorkflowInstance)
    (binding : WorkflowTaskBinding) (ctx : PolicyContext)
    (h_sys : SystemInvariant s)
    (h_compliant : WorkflowPolicyCompliant s wi binding ctx) :
    -- If compliant, then policy must not have denied the tasks
    ∀ n : Nat, n ∈ wi.definition.nodes ->
      wi.node_states n = .pending ->
      ∃ task : WorkflowTask, binding n = some task /\
        policy_check s.kernel.policy task.action ctx ≠ .deny := by
  intro n h_in h_pending
  obtain ⟨auth, _⟩ := h_compliant n h_in h_pending
  refine ⟨auth.task, auth.h_binding, ?_⟩
  -- From TaskAuthorizable, we have a capability that authorizes
  obtain ⟨_capId, _h_held, _cap, _h_get, h_auth⟩ := auth.h_authorizable
  unfold authorize at h_auth
  -- h_auth.1 : policy_check = .permit
  intro h_deny
  rw [h_deny] at h_auth
  exact absurd h_auth.1 (by decide)

end PolicyWorkflowBridge

/-! =========== BRIDGE 2: SystemInvariant Preservation Through Workflow =========== -/

section WorkflowInvariantPreservation

/-
**Gap Being Bridged**:
- SecurityComposition proves: Step s s' → SystemInvariant s → SystemInvariant s'
- But workflow execution goes through multiple steps
- We need: WorkflowExecutionSafe + SystemInvariant preserved across workflow

**Key Insight**:
Workflow execution is a SEQUENCE of Steps. We use the existing Reachable type
which is the reflexive-transitive closure of Step. SecurityComposition already
proves Step preserves SystemInvariant, so reachable_satisfies_invariant
(in SystemInvariant.lean) gives us the multi-step result.
-/

/--
**Bridge Theorem 2.1: Reachable states maintain SystemInvariant**

This is actually already proven in SystemInvariant.lean as
`reachable_satisfies_invariant`. We re-state it here for the bridge.
-/

    (s : State)
    (h_init : SystemInvariant s)
    (s' : State)

  induction h_reach with
  | refl => exact h_init
  | step _h_reach' h_step ih =>
      exact security_composition _ _ ih h_step

/--
**Bridge Theorem 2.2: Safe Workflow Maintains Security**

If a workflow is execution-safe AND system invariant holds,
then any state reachable during workflow execution maintains security.

Proof: Direct from reachable_maintains_system_invariant.
-/
theorem safe_workflow_reachable_secure
    (s : State) (wi : WorkflowInstance)
    (binding : WorkflowTaskBinding) (ctx : PolicyContext) (now : Time)

    (h_sys : SystemInvariant s)
    (s' : State)
    (h_reach : Reachable s s') :
    SystemInvariant s' :=
  reachable_maintains_system_invariant s h_sys s' h_reach

end WorkflowInvariantPreservation

/-! =========== BRIDGE 3: ComponentSafe Extension for Policy =========== -/

section ComponentPolicyBridge

/-
**Gap Being Bridged**:
- ComponentSafe has: unforgeable, confined, isolated, compliant
- ComponentSafe does NOT have: policy compliance for actions
- WorkflowPolicyCompliant checks policy at task level

**Design Decision**:
We introduce ComponentPolicySafe which adds policy compliance to ComponentSafe.
This is SEPARATE from ComponentSafe because:
1. ComponentSafe is about CAPABILITY safety (static)
2. Policy compliance is about ACTION authorization (dynamic)

**Architecture Note**:
The existing infrastructure uses ComponentStructInv (held_in_table, held_owned)
alongside SystemInvariant. We bridge to this existing structure via
componentSafe_fromPlugin_of_invariants from Bridge.lean.
-/

/--
**ComponentPolicySafe**: Component respects policy for all its actions.

This extends ComponentSafe with policy compliance:
- For any action the component could perform,
- If policy denies it, the component cannot be authorized for it
- (This is the PolicySound property lifted to component level)
-/
structure ComponentPolicySafe (s : State) (c : Component) : Prop where
  /-- Base safety properties -/
  base_safe : ComponentSafe s c
  /-- Policy soundness at component level -/
  policy_sound : ∀ (a : Action) (ctx : PolicyContext),
    a.subject = c.pid →
    policy_check s.kernel.policy a ctx = .deny →
    ¬ ∃ (auth : Authorized s a), auth.ctx = ctx

/--
**Bridge Theorem 3.1: SystemInvariant + ComponentStructInv => ComponentPolicySafe**

If SystemInvariant and ComponentStructInv both hold, every component satisfies
ComponentPolicySafe.

Proof: Uses componentSafe_fromPlugin_of_invariants (from Bridge.lean) for base_safe,
and PolicySound from SystemInvariant for policy_sound.

Note: ComponentStructInv is a structural invariant that needs to be maintained
alongside SystemInvariant. It captures: held caps exist in table AND have correct holder.

/--
**Bridge Theorem 3.1a: For initial state, ComponentStructInv holds vacuously**

For init_state, all plugins have empty heldCaps, so ComponentStructInv holds.
-/
theorem init_state_has_struct_inv : ComponentStructInv init_state := by
  constructor
  -- held_in_table: vacuously true (no held caps)
  · intro pid capId h_held
    -- init_state has empty_plugin with heldCaps = ∅

  -- held_owned: vacuously true (no held caps)
  · intro pid capId h_held
    simp only [init_state, empty_plugin] at h_held
    exact False.elim (Finset.not_mem_empty capId h_held)

/--
**Bridge Theorem 3.2: ComponentPolicySafe for initial state**

For init_state, ComponentPolicySafe holds for all components.
-/
theorem init_state_component_policy_safe (pid : PluginId) :
    ComponentPolicySafe init_state (Component.fromPlugin init_state pid) :=
  system_invariant_implies_component_policy_safe

    init_satisfies_invariant
    init_state_has_struct_inv
    pid

/--
**Bridge Theorem 3.3: ComponentPolicySafe + TaskAuthorizable => Component can execute task**

If a component is policy-safe AND a task is authorizable,
then the component can safely execute the task.

This connects component-level safety to workflow task authorization.
-/
theorem component_policy_safe_enables_task
    (s : State) (c : Component) (task : WorkflowTask) (ctx : PolicyContext)
    (h_safe : ComponentPolicySafe s c)
    (h_task_plugin : task.plugin = c.pid)
    (h_auth : TaskAuthorizable s task ctx) :
    -- Policy must permit (since task is authorizable)
    policy_check s.kernel.policy task.action ctx = .permit := by
  -- From TaskAuthorizable, we get authorize which includes policy permit
  obtain ⟨_capId, _h_held, _cap, _h_get, h_authorize⟩ := h_auth
  unfold authorize at h_authorize
  exact h_authorize.1

end ComponentPolicyBridge

**Bridge Theorem 4.2: Full Integration - Safe Workflow in Secure System**

If:

2. Workflow is execution-safe (properly authorized, bounded, etc.)

Then:

**Bridge Theorem 4.3: No Policy Bypass Through Workflows**

If SystemInvariant holds (including PolicySound), then no workflow execution
can bypass policy checks.

This is the security guarantee: workflows cannot circumvent authorization.
