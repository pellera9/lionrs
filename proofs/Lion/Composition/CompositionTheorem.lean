========================================

THE COMPOSITIONAL SECURITY THEOREM (v1 Theorem 2.2)

Core thesis: "If parts are safe, entirety is safe"

Formal statement:
  ∀ A, B ∈ Components:
    ComponentSafe(A) ∧ ComponentSafe(B) ∧ Compatible(A, B)
    ⟹ ComponentSafe(A ⊕ B)

This is the main theorem that enables modular security reasoning.
Instead of proving the entire system is secure, we:
1. Prove each component is secure (ComponentSafe)
2. Prove components are compatible (Compatible)
3. Derive system security by composition

Based on:
- v1 Theorem 2.2 (Component Composition Security Preservation)
- v1 Lemma 2.2.1 (Compositional Security Properties)
- v1 Lemma 2.2.2 (Interface Compatibility Preserves Security)

/-! =========== COMPONENT COMPOSITION OPERATOR =========== -/

/--
Component composition operator (A ⊕ B).

When two components are composed:
- One component (A) "hosts" the composition (provides pid for isolation)
- Source pids are the union (for ownership tracking)
- Held capabilities are the union
- Security level is the maximum (most restrictive)

The choice of A as host is arbitrary - the security properties
are symmetric given Compatible(A, B).

**Theorem 2.2: Component Composition Security Preservation**

If component A is safe, component B is safe, and they are compatible,
then their composition A ⊕ B is also safe.

This is the cornerstone of compositional security reasoning:
- Security is modular: verify components independently
- Composition preserves security: no new vulnerabilities at interfaces
- Scales to n components by induction

The proof proceeds by showing each of the four ComponentSafe properties
is preserved under composition:

1. **Unforgeable**: Union of unforgeable cap sets is unforgeable
   - Caps from A are sealed (by hA.unforgeable)
   - Caps from B are sealed (by hB.unforgeable)
   - Union inherits both properties

2. **Confined (revocation-safe)**: Held capabilities remain valid
   - A's caps are valid in the kernel table (by hA.confined)
   - B's caps are valid in the kernel table (by hB.confined)
   - Union preserves validity (no new invalid caps introduced)
   - Note: This is revocation-safety (IsValid), not rights authority

3. **Isolated**: Memory isolation is preserved
   - A's memory is bounded (by hA.isolated)
   - Compatible ensures A and B have disjoint memory
   - Composition uses A's memory (A is host)

4. **Compliant**: Ownership tracking is preserved
   - A's caps have holders in A.sourcePids
   - B's caps have holders in B.sourcePids
   - Union of sourcePids contains all holders

/-! =========== CONNECTION TO SYSTEM INVARIANT =========== -/

/--
Every capability in the table is held by some plugin.

This is a completeness property: the table only contains caps that are
actually held by plugins. This excludes orphaned or stale table entries.

In a well-formed system:
- Caps are added to the table when created via cap_delegate
- Caps are added to heldCaps when accepted via cap_accept
- The table is a superset of held caps (caps in heldCaps are in table)
- For this property, we require the converse: caps in table are held

This may not hold in general (e.g., caps created but not yet accepted),
so it's an explicit precondition for deriving CapUnforgeable from
AllComponentsSafe.

**Theorem: AllComponentsSafe implies SystemInvariant properties**

If all components are individually safe and every table cap is held,
the system-level invariants hold.

This connects the compositional approach to the existing SystemInvariant
structure, showing they are consistent.

Note: Requires AllCapsHeld as precondition because CapUnforgeable covers
ALL caps in the table, but ComponentSafe only covers caps held by plugins.
Without AllCapsHeld, orphaned table entries wouldn't be covered.

### Theorem 2.1: Cross-Component Capability Flow Preservation

From v1 ch2-3: "In the Lion ecosystem, capability authority is preserved across
component boundaries, and capability references remain unforgeable during
inter-component communication."

Formal Statement:
  ∀ s₁, s₂ ∈ Components, ∀ c ∈ Capabilities:
    send(s₁, s₂, c) ⟹ (authority(c) = authority(receive(s₂, c)) ∧ unforgeable(c))

The proof proceeds through three key lemmas.

**Lemma 2.1.1: WASM Isolation Preserves Capability References**

WebAssembly isolation boundaries preserve capability reference integrity.
Capability references cross boundaries as opaque handles that are:
- Injective: Different capabilities map to different handles
- Unguessable: Handles are cryptographically bound to capability IDs
- Unforgeable: WebAssembly cannot construct valid handles without kernel assistance

This follows from:
1. Host memory separation: Capabilities stored in kernel space
2. Memory access restriction: WASM modules operate in separate linear memory
3. Handle abstraction: handle : Capability → CapId is injective
-/
theorem wasm_isolation_preserves_refs (s : State) (pid : PluginId)
    (h_safe : ComponentSafe s (Component.fromPlugin s pid)) :
    -- All capabilities held by the plugin have valid seals (unforgeable)
    ∀ capId ∈ (s.plugins pid).heldCaps,
      ∃ cap, s.kernel.revocation.caps.get? capId = some cap ∧
             Capability.verify_seal s.kernel.hmacKey cap := by
  intro capId h_held
  -- Component.fromPlugin builds a component from the plugin state
  -- h_safe.unforgeable applies to heldCapIds which equals heldCaps
  have h_in_component : capId ∈ (Component.fromPlugin s pid).heldCapIds := h_held
  exact h_safe.unforgeable capId h_in_component

/--
**Lemma 2.1.1a: Handle Abstraction is Injective**

The handle mapping from capabilities to IDs is injective - different capabilities
have different handles. This is structural: CapId is the unique identifier.
-/
theorem handle_injective :
    ∀ (cap1 cap2 : Capability), cap1.id = cap2.id →
      (∀ caps : CapTable, caps.get? cap1.id = some cap1 →
        caps.get? cap2.id = some cap2 → cap1 = cap2) := by
  intro cap1 cap2 h_id_eq caps h1 h2
  rw [h_id_eq] at h1
  rw [h1] at h2
  cases h2; rfl

/--
**Lemma 2.1.2: Capability Transfer Protocol Preserves Authority**

The inter-component capability transfer protocol preserves authority.
When a capability crosses component boundaries:
1. The capability ID is preserved (same handle)
2. The seal is validated at both ends
3. Authority is determined by the kernel table, not local state

This holds because:
- Transfer only passes capability IDs (handles)
- The actual capability data is looked up from kernel state
- Kernel state is unchanged by the transfer

  -- A vouches for the capability

**Lemma 2.1.2a: Authority is Kernel-Determined**

The authority of a capability is determined solely by the kernel table.
Components cannot modify capability authority locally.

  cases this; rfl

**Lemma 2.1.3: Policy Compliance During Transfer**

All capability transfers respect the system's policy.
A capability is only transferred if permitted by the policy engine.

In Lion, policy checks occur at the authorization level (Authorized witness),
so transfers that occur are implicitly policy-compliant.

**Theorem 2.1: Cross-Component Capability Flow Preservation (Combined)**

Combines all three lemmas to prove the full theorem.
When capability c is sent from component A to component B:
1. The capability's authority set is unchanged (authority preservation)
2. The capability remains unforgeable (reference integrity)
3. The transfer is policy-compliant (authorization)
