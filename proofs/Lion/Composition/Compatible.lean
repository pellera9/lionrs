Lion/Composition/Compatible.lean
================================

Interface compatibility predicate for component composition (v1 Definition 2.4).

Two components are compatible if they can safely communicate:
1. Their security levels allow information flow
2. Their memory regions are disjoint (no shared mutable state)
3. Any shared capabilities are validly transferred

This is a precondition for the Composition Theorem (v1 Theorem 2.2):
  secure(A) ∧ secure(B) ∧ compatible(A, B) ⟹ secure(A ⊕ B)

Based on:
- v1 Definition 2.4 (Compatible Composition)
- v1 Lemma 2.2.2 (Interface Compatibility Preserves Security)

import Lion.Composition.ComponentSafe

namespace Lion

/-! =========== COMMUNICATION PREDICATE =========== -/

/-- Two security levels can communicate if information can flow between them.
    Communication is allowed if the sender's level flows to the receiver's level
    (i.e., sender ≤ receiver in the security lattice). -/
def can_communicate (sender receiver : SecurityLevel) : Prop :=
  SecurityLevel.flows_to sender receiver

Compatible: Two components can safely compose.

Compatibility ensures that component composition doesn't introduce
new attack surfaces. The key properties are:

1. **Level Compatible**: Security levels allow bidirectional or unidirectional
   information flow (respects Bell-LaPadula / Biba)

2. **Memory Disjoint**: No address is in both components' memory regions.
   This ensures isolation is preserved under composition.

3. **Shared Caps Valid**: Any capabilities that appear in both components'
   held sets are properly validated for sharing.

Based on v1 Definition 2.4 and Lemma 2.2.2.
