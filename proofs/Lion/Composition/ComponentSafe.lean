Lion/Composition/ComponentSafe.lean
===================================

Component-level safety predicate (v1 Definition 2.5).

The compositional security thesis: "If parts are safe, entirety is safe"
requires defining what it means for an individual component to be safe.

This file defines:
1. Component - a plugin with its held capabilities and security level
2. ComponentSafe - four-part security predicate
   - Unforgeable: all held capabilities are properly sealed
   - Confined: capabilities exist in table (handle integrity, not validity)
   - Isolated: memory is within WASM bounds
   - Compliant: capabilities are properly owned by source plugins

Handle/State Separation Model:
- Plugins hold CapId handles, not Capability copies
- Validity checked at USE time (cap_invoke, cap_delegate), not possession time
- Revoked caps remain as handles but fail IsValid check when used

Based on:
- v1 Definition 2.5 (Component Security)
- v1 Theorem 2.2 (Security Composition)

A Component is a logical unit of execution in the Lion system.
It represents a plugin along with its held capabilities and security level.

Components are the units of compositional reasoning - we prove each component
is safe, then prove composition preserves safety.

The `sourcePids` field tracks which plugins contribute capabilities to this
component. For a simple component, this is just {pid}. For composed components,
it's the union of source pids. This enables the compliant property to verify
that held capabilities have valid holders.

ComponentSafe: Four-part security predicate (v1 Definition 2.5).

A component is safe if:
1. **Unforgeable**: All capabilities it holds are properly sealed with kernel HMAC
2. **Confined (revocation-safe)**: Its capabilities are valid (IsValid) in the table
   - This means the cap exists and is not revoked
   - Note: This is NOT rights-based authority confinement; that is a separate concern
     handled by Confinement.table_invariant at the system level
3. **Isolated**: Its memory operations stay within WASM bounds
4. **Compliant**: Its capabilities have holders ∈ sourcePids (ownership tracking)

This predicate enables compositional reasoning: if A and B are each ComponentSafe,
and they are Compatible, then their composition is also ComponentSafe.

  /-- Capabilities exist in the kernel table (handle integrity).
