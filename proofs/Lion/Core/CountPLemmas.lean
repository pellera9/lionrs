===========================

Helper lemmas for List.countP updates needed for workflow measure proofs.

These lemmas establish how countP changes when the predicate changes
for exactly one element in the list.

**Lemma (countP with function update - decrease)**

When we update a function `f` so that element `a` no longer satisfies the predicate,
and `a` appears exactly once in the list, countP decreases by 1.

This captures: pending count decreases when node goes pending -> active.

**Lemma (countP with function update - increase)**

When we update a function `f` so that element `a` now satisfies the predicate,
and `a` appears exactly once in the list, countP increases by 1.

This captures: active count increases when node goes pending -> active.

**Lemma (Start Node Measure Decreases)**

When pending -> active:

This proves the measure strictly decreases.
