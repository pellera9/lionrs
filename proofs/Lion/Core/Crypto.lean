## Split-View Cryptography Pattern

We use a "split-view" approach to handle the tension between:
1. **Logical proofs** need injectivity (different payloads → different tags)
2. **Crypto proofs** only guarantee negligible collision probability

Solution:
- `SymbolicTag`: Inductive type where injectivity holds BY CONSTRUCTION
- `serializeTag`: Maps symbolic tags to bytes for crypto analysis

This avoids the Pigeonhole Principle violation of claiming a hash function
is perfectly injective (infinite domain → finite range).
-/

/-- Secret key type (256-bit) - concrete for derived instances -/
def Key := List UInt8
deriving DecidableEq, Repr

/--
Symbolic HMAC tag - an inductive type representing "the tag that would be
produced by HMAC(key, payload)".

Injectivity holds by constructor laws: if SymbolicTag.mk k₁ p₁ = SymbolicTag.mk k₂ p₂,
then k₁ = k₂ and p₁ = p₂. This is a theorem, not an axiom.

**IMPORTANT**: SymbolicTag is for PROOF purposes only. Plugins never see this type.
At runtime, capabilities contain opaque `SealedTag` bytes.
-/
inductive SymbolicTag where
  | mk (key : Key) (payload : ByteArray) : SymbolicTag
deriving DecidableEq

instance : Repr SymbolicTag where
  reprPrec _ _ := "«SymbolicTag»"

/-- Key inhabitation (auto-derived from List UInt8) -/
instance : Inhabited Key := ⟨[]⟩

instance : Inhabited SymbolicTag where
  default := SymbolicTag.mk default ByteArray.empty

/-- Alias for backward compatibility (proof-internal only) -/
abbrev Tag := SymbolicTag

/-- HMAC-SHA256 computation (symbolic) -/
def hmac (k : Key) (m : ByteArray) : SymbolicTag :=
  SymbolicTag.mk k m

/--
**Theorem (HMAC Injectivity - Provable, Not Axiom)**

For the same key, different messages produce different symbolic tags.
This follows directly from the constructor laws of SymbolicTag.
-/
theorem hmac_injective_under_key_proven :
    ∀ (k : Key) (m₁ m₂ : ByteArray),
      m₁ ≠ m₂ → hmac k m₁ ≠ hmac k m₂ := by
  intro k m₁ m₂ h_diff h_eq
  simp only [hmac, SymbolicTag.mk.injEq] at h_eq
  exact h_diff h_eq.2

/--
**Theorem (Full HMAC Injectivity)**

Different (key, message) pairs produce different symbolic tags.
-/
theorem hmac_full_injective :
    ∀ (k₁ k₂ : Key) (m₁ m₂ : ByteArray),
      (k₁ ≠ k₂ ∨ m₁ ≠ m₂) → hmac k₁ m₁ ≠ hmac k₂ m₂ := by
  intro k₁ k₂ m₁ m₂ h_diff h_eq
  simp only [hmac, SymbolicTag.mk.injEq] at h_eq
  cases h_diff with
  | inl hk => exact hk h_eq.1
  | inr hm => exact hm h_eq.2

## Serialization (for Crypto Proofs)

The actual bytes of a tag are only relevant for the cryptographic
unforgeability proof in Theorems/Unforgeability.lean.
-/

/-- Serialize symbolic tag to bytes (for crypto analysis) -/
opaque serializeTag : SymbolicTag → ByteArray

-- serializeTag_injective: REMOVED (unused, kept opaque definition for future use)

/-- Capability payload (data to be sealed) -/
structure CapPayload where
  holder : PluginId
  target : ResourceId
  rights : Rights
  parent : Option CapId
  epoch  : Nat  -- For revocation tracking

/-- Serialize capability payload to bytes -/
opaque serializeCap : CapPayload → ByteArray

-- serializeCap_injective: REMOVED (unused, kept opaque definition for future use)

/-!
## Runtime Seal Representation

To prevent key leakage in the formal model (where low-equivalence compares
plugin states), we separate:
- `SealedTag`: Opaque bytes that plugins hold (key NOT visible)
- `SymbolicTag`: Proof-internal representation (key visible for proofs)

The kernel maintains the correspondence; plugins only see `SealedTag`.
-/

/-- Sealed tag - what plugins actually hold at runtime.
    The key is NOT part of this type's structure.
    Concrete for derived instances. -/
def SealedTag := List UInt8
deriving DecidableEq, Repr

instance : Inhabited SealedTag := ⟨[]⟩

/-- Seal a capability payload with the kernel key (produces opaque bytes) -/
opaque seal_payload : Key → CapPayload → SealedTag

/-- Verify a sealed tag against a key and payload -/
opaque verify_seal_runtime : Key → CapPayload → SealedTag → Bool

/-! =========== SEAL ASSUMPTIONS =========== -/

**Seal Assumptions Record**

Bundles seal-related cryptographic axioms into a single record.

    verify_seal_runtime k p (seal_payload k p) = true :=
  seal_assumptions.seal_verify_roundtrip

/--
Correspondence between SealedTag and SymbolicTag (kernel-internal only).
This is used in proofs to connect runtime verification to symbolic reasoning.
Plugins NEVER have access to this correspondence.

## Key Change: Injectivity is PROVEN, not AXIOMATIZED

The old `hmac_injective_under_key` axiom was mathematically unsound
(violated Pigeonhole Principle). With SymbolicTag, injectivity is a
theorem that follows from constructor laws.

For backward compatibility, we provide `hmac_injective_under_key` as
an alias to the proven theorem.
-/

/-- Backward-compatible alias for hmac_injective_under_key_proven -/
theorem hmac_injective_under_key :
    ∀ (k : Key) (m₁ m₂ : ByteArray),
      m₁ ≠ m₂ → hmac k m₁ ≠ hmac k m₂ :=
  hmac_injective_under_key_proven

/--
Seal injectivity: capabilities with different payloads have different signatures.
This follows from seal_injective_payload axiom on the runtime SealedTag.
-/
theorem seal_injective_on_payload (k : Key) (c₁ c₂ : Capability) :
    c₁.payload ≠ c₂.payload →
    Capability.verify_seal k c₁ →
    Capability.verify_seal k c₂ →
    c₁.signature ≠ c₂.signature := by
  intro h_diff h_seal₁ h_seal₂ h_eq

  have h₁ : c₁.signature = seal_payload k c₁.payload :=
    verified_seal_is_canonical k c₁.payload c₁.signature h_seal₁
  have h₂ : c₂.signature = seal_payload k c₂.payload :=
    verified_seal_is_canonical k c₂.payload c₂.signature h_seal₂
  -- If signatures equal, then seal_payload outputs equal
  rw [h₁, h₂] at h_eq
  -- By seal injectivity, payloads must be equal
  have h_payload_eq := seal_injective_payload k c₁.payload c₂.payload h_eq
  -- But we assumed payloads differ - contradiction

## Forgery Resistance

Formal forgery resistance is proven in Theorems/Unforgeability.lean
using game-based cryptographic reductions on the serialized form.

**Hash Assumptions Record**

Bundles hash/event-related cryptographic axioms into a single record.

Note: BLAKE3 collision resistance is now a theorem (provable from symbolic model),
so only serializeEvent_injective remains as an assumption.

2. hash_assumptions: BLAKE3 collision resistance (via serializeEvent injectivity)

Note: cap_mac_security lives in Theorems/Unforgeability.lean as it's specific
to the UF-CMA game. This bundle covers the foundational crypto primitives.

**Theorem: Chain Integrity from Collision Resistance**

With collision resistance, hash chain integrity is guaranteed:
if two chains have the same final hash, they must be identical.
