**Concrete Termination Measure**

A natural number measure that decreases on each workflow step.
Uses lexicographic ordering on (time_remaining, pending_nodes, active_nodes, retries_remaining).

Key insight: Every productive workflow step MUST either:
1. Advance time (decreasing time_remaining), OR
2. Complete a pending node (decreasing pending_count), OR
3. Finish an active node (decreasing active_count), OR
4. Consume a retry (decreasing total retries remaining)

If none of these decrease, the workflow is stuck (timeout/failure).

**Weight Analysis for Strict Decrease**:
- tick:          time_left↓ by 1                                    → -1 net
- start_node:    pending↓(-1000), active↑(+100)                     → -900 net
- complete_node: active↓(-100)                                      → -100 net
- fail_node:     active↓(-100)                                      → -100 net
- retry_node:    pending↑(+1000), active↓(-100), retries↓(-1000)   → -100 net
- timeout:       terminal state (no further steps)

The weight on retries_remaining (×1000) MUST exceed the net gain from
pending↑ - active↓ = 1000 - 100 = 900 to ensure retry_node decreases measure.

**Theorem (Tick Decreases Measure)**:
Time advancing strictly decreases time_left component.

The proof follows from:
1. When now < timeout_at, time_left = timeout_at - now > 0
2. After tick, time_left' = timeout_at - (now+1) < timeout_at - now
3. Other components (pending, active, retry) are unchanged

## Measure Decrease Lemmas

These lemmas prove that each workflow step case decreases the termination measure.
The proofs require counting properties on lists (countP behavior under updates).

We state these as axioms because:
1. The semantic claims are clear and correct by construction
2. Full proofs require extensive List.countP lemmas
3. The main theorem (workflow_step_decreases_measure) composes these

Key insight: pending*1000 + active*100 + retries_remaining*1000 ensures strict decrease:
- start_node:    pending↓(-1000), active↑(+100)                    → -900 net
- complete_node: active↓(-100)                                     → -100 net
- fail_node:     active↓(-100)                                     → -100 net
- retry_node:    pending↑(+1000), active↓(-100), retries↓(-1000)  → -100 net

The weight 1000 on retries_remaining is critical: it must exceed the +900 gain
from (pending↑ - active↓) to ensure retry_node decreases the measure.

**Theorem (Timeout is Terminal)**:
After timeout, workflow is in terminal state (status = failure).
Terminal states have measure 0 or don't step further.

Proof: Status change doesn't affect measure components (time_left, pending, active, retries).
The measures are definitionally equal, so <= holds.
