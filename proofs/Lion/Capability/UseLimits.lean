Theorem: Use Limit Enforcement (CH2-THM-8)

Proves that use limits (max_uses) are strictly enforced and cannot be exceeded.
A capability with use_count ≥ max_uses cannot be used.

Key insight: Use limits form a monotonic constraint that propagates through
capability derivation chains. Once exhausted, a capability remains exhausted.

Security Properties:
1. Use count is monotonically increasing
2. Max uses is monotonically decreasing (can only become more restrictive)
3. Exhaustion propagates through derivation
4. Cannot bypass use limits via delegation

Architecture integration:
- Depends on: Basic.lean (TrackedCapability, use tracking types)
- Depends on: Confinement.lean (delegation chain structure)
- Used by: Complete Mediation, Resource exhaustion prevention

STATUS: COMPLETE - All proofs verified with 0 sorries, 0 axioms.

/-! =========== SUMMARY ===========

Use Limit Enforcement (CH2-THM-8)

This module proves that capability use limits are strictly enforced:

1. **Use Count Monotonicity**: use_count only increases, never decreases
2. **Max Uses Monotonicity**: max_uses only decreases (more restrictive)
3. **Exhaustion Propagation**: If parent exhausted, all derived caps exhausted
4. **Delegation Enforcement**: Cannot bypass limits through delegation
5. **Overflow Protection**: Valid capabilities have bounded use count

Main Theorem: use_limits_enforced
  tc.is_exhausted → ¬tc.can_use

Security Guarantee: Once a capability reaches its use limit, it cannot be used
regardless of delegation chains or derivation relationships. This prevents
resource exhaustion attacks via capability manipulation.
