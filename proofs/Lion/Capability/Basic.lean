==========================

Capability use tracking and common definitions for capability theorems.

This module provides:
1. Use counting types (UseCount, MaxUses)
2. Exhaustion predicates
3. Capability derivation relations
4. Re-exports of core capability types

Architecture integration:
- Built on: Lion.Core.Crypto (Capability structure)
- Built on: Lion.State.Kernel (CapTable, IsValid)
- Used by: UseLimits, Confinement, Revocation theorems

STATUS: COMPLETE - All definitions verified.

/-! =========== SUMMARY ===========

Capability Basic Module

This module provides the foundation for capability use tracking:

1. **UseCount/MaxUses Types**: Natural number tracking for capability usage
2. **TrackedCapability**: Extended capability with use count and max uses
3. **Exhaustion Predicates**: is_exhausted, can_use for use limit checking
4. **Derivation Relations**: Derives, DerivesTransitive for capability chains
5. **TrackedDerivation**: Derivation with use count/max uses propagation rules

These definitions support the UseLimits theorem (CH2-THM-8) and integrate
with the existing capability confinement and revocation theorems.
