Lion/Theorems/Mediation.lean
=============================

Complete Mediation theorem (from D3 deep dive).
Every effectful operation is mediated by capability AND policy check.

This is trivially true by construction: you cannot build a `Step.host_call`
without providing an `Authorized` witness, which contains all the proofs.

**Theorem (Complete Mediation)**:
Every effectful operation is properly mediated.

Proof: By case analysis on Step.
- plugin_internal: Not effectful, trivially true.
- host_call: Effectful. The `Authorized` witness in the constructor
  contains h_cap (capability_check) and h_pol (policy_check = permit).
- kernel_internal: Not effectful, trivially true.

This is the **key theorem** that makes the whole architecture work.

**Corollary (No Bypass)**:
There is no execution path that allows an effectful operation
without proper authorization.

/-! =========== NO AMBIENT AUTHORITY =========== -/

/--
**Theorem (No Ambient Authority - Step)**:
An effectful operation requires presenting a capability.
There is no "ambient" authority based on identity alone.

**Theorem (Tamperproof)**:
Authorization state cannot be modified by untrusted code.
Plugin-internal steps do not affect kernel state.

Every trust-boundary crossing is a host_call.
