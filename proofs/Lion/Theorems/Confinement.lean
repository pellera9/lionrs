Theorem 004: Capability Confinement

Proves that delegated capabilities can never exceed the rights of their parent.
This is foundational for the principle of least authority.

Key insight: Rights form a **bounded semilattice with intersection**, and
delegation chain induction proves monotonicity - capabilities can only be
attenuated, never amplified.

Security Properties:
1. Delegated rights <= parent rights
2. No capability amplification possible
3. Combining capabilities via intersection cannot exceed inputs

Architecture integration:
- Depends on: 001 (Unforgeability) - capabilities cannot be forged with elevated rights
- Used by: 005 (Revocation), 009 (Policy), Complete Mediation

STATUS: COMPLETE - All proofs verified with 0 sorries.

/-! =========== SUMMARY ===========

Capability Confinement (Theorem 004)

This module proves that capabilities in Lion can only be attenuated, never amplified:

1. Semilattice Structure: Rights form a bounded meet-semilattice under intersection
2. Delegation Monotonicity: Each delegation step enforces rights ⊆ parent.rights
3. Chain Confinement: By induction, c.rights ⊆ root.rights for any delegation chain
4. Combination Attenuation: Combining capabilities via intersection never amplifies
5. Authorization Integration: The Authorized witness enforces confinement at runtime
6. Constraint Immutability: Rights cannot be modified after creation (Lean semantics)

These properties together ensure the Principle of Least Authority (POLA):
plugins can only act with rights bounded by their delegation chain back to root capabilities.
