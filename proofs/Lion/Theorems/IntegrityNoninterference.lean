============================================

Integrity Noninterference (Biba dual of Confidentiality NI)

Proves: Low-integrity data cannot influence high-integrity outputs.
This is the dual of the confidentiality noninterference in Noninterference.lean.

Security Property (Biba Model):
  A low-integrity principal cannot corrupt high-integrity data.
  Low-integrity inputs cannot affect high-integrity outputs.

Mathematical Foundation:
- Biba (1977): Integrity Considerations for Secure Computer Systems
- Goguen & Meseguer (1982): Security Policies and Security Models
- Sabelfeld & Myers (2003): Language-based Information-flow Security

Relationship to Confidentiality NI:
- Confidentiality: high → low flows prohibited (secrets don't leak)
- Integrity: low → high flows prohibited (trusted data not corrupted)
- Same unwinding structure, dual direction

STATUS: Framework established with key theorems

/-! =========== PART 1: INTEGRITY LEVELS =========== -/

/--
Integrity level (dual of security level for confidentiality).
Higher values = more trusted (opposite of Biba's original formulation
but consistent with our SecurityLevel ordering).
-/
abbrev IntegrityLevel := SecurityLevel

/--
Integrity ordering: higher level = more trusted.
An entity at level H trusts data from levels >= H.
-/
def trusts (observer trusted : IntegrityLevel) : Prop :=
  observer ≤ trusted

/--
Integrity dominates: high integrity entity can receive from low integrity,
but low integrity cannot write to high integrity.
-/
def can_write_to (writer reader : IntegrityLevel) : Prop :=
  writer ≥ reader  -- Writer must be at least as trusted as reader

/-! =========== PART 2: INTEGRITY EQUIVALENCE =========== -/

/-- Resource integrity level based on owner.
    Imported from Lion.Step.Authorization. -/
def resource_integrity (s : State) (rid : MemAddr) : IntegrityLevel :=
  Lion.resource_integrity s rid

/--
High-integrity equivalence: states agree on high-integrity data.
Two states are H-integrity-equivalent if all data at integrity >= H matches.
-/
def high_integrity_equiv (H : IntegrityLevel) (s1 s2 : State) : Prop :=
  -- High-integrity plugins have identical state
  (∀ pid, (s1.plugins pid).level ≥ H → s1.plugins pid = s2.plugins pid) ∧
  -- High-integrity kernel state matches (kernel is highest integrity)
  (H ≤ .Secret → s1.kernel = s2.kernel) ∧
  -- High-integrity resources match
  (∀ rid, resource_integrity s1 rid ≥ H →
    s1.ghost.resources.get? rid = s2.ghost.resources.get? rid)

/-! =========== PART 3: INTEGRITY UNWINDING CONDITIONS =========== -/

/-- Integrity level of a step -/
def step_integrity {s s' : State} (st : Step s s') : IntegrityLevel :=
  st.level

/-- High-integrity state preserved between states -/
def high_integrity_preserved (H : IntegrityLevel) (s s' : State) : Prop :=
  -- High-integrity plugins unchanged
  (∀ pid, (s.plugins pid).level ≥ H → s'.plugins pid = s.plugins pid) ∧
  -- Security-critical kernel fields preserved (hmacKey and policy)
  -- Note: kernel.revocation CAN change for cap ops, but for integrity
  -- we only need the security-critical signing key and policy to be preserved
  (H ≤ .Secret → s'.kernel.hmacKey = s.kernel.hmacKey ∧ s'.kernel.policy = s.kernel.policy)

/--
**Integrity Output Consistency**:
H-integrity-equivalent states have identical high-integrity outputs.

If two states agree on high-integrity data, any output that affects
high-integrity state must be identical.
-/
def integrity_output_consistent (H : IntegrityLevel) : Prop :=
  ∀ (s1 s2 : State),
    high_integrity_equiv H s1 s2 →
    ∀ pid, (s1.plugins pid).level ≥ H →
      s1.plugins pid = s2.plugins pid

/--
**Integrity Step Consistency**:
H-integrity-equivalent states step to H-integrity-equivalent states
when the step is by a high-integrity principal.

High-integrity computations behave identically on H-equivalent states.
-/
def integrity_step_consistent (H : IntegrityLevel) : Prop :=
  ∀ (s1 s2 s1' : State),
    high_integrity_equiv H s1 s2 →
    ∀ (st1 : Step s1 s1'),
      step_integrity st1 ≥ H →
      ∃ s2', (Nonempty (Step s2 s2')) ∧ high_integrity_equiv H s1' s2'

/--
**Integrity Confinement**:
Low-integrity steps preserve high-integrity state.

When a low-integrity principal acts, it cannot modify any high-integrity
observable state. This is the core Biba property.
-/
def integrity_confinement (H : IntegrityLevel) : Prop :=
  ∀ (s s' : State),
    ∀ (st : Step s s'),
      step_integrity st < H →
      high_integrity_preserved H s s'

/-! =========== PART 4: MAIN INTEGRITY THEOREMS =========== -/

/--
**Theorem (Integrity Output Consistency Holds)**:
H-equivalent states produce identical high-integrity outputs.

Proof: By definition of high_integrity_equiv.
-/

    integrity_output_consistent H := by
  intro s1 s2 h_equiv pid h_high
  exact h_equiv.1 pid h_high

/--
**Theorem (was Axiom): Authorized Write Requires Dominance**
If an action with Write rights is authorized, then the actor's integrity level
must dominate the target resource's integrity level.
This is the Biba "no write-up" enforcement for resource modification.

CONVERTED FROM AXIOM: Now provable via Authorized.h_biba field (Phase 9).

    (auth : Authorized s a) (h_write : Right.Write ∈ a.rights) :
    (s.plugins a.subject).level ≥ resource_integrity s a.target :=
  auth.h_biba h_write

/--
**Theorem (No Low-to-High Flow)**:
Low-integrity principals cannot write to high-integrity resources.

This is enforced by the authorization system: capability.target.level
must be <= capability.holder.level for writes.
-/

**Theorem (Integrity Confinement Holds)**:
Low-integrity steps cannot modify high-integrity state.

Proof: By case analysis on step types:
- plugin_internal: Low-integrity plugin only affects itself; high-integrity plugins unchanged
- host_call: Low-integrity caller only affects itself; high-integrity plugins unchanged
- kernel_internal: Kernel is at Secret level (max), so step_integrity < H is vacuously false

/--
Two plugins can communicate if messages can flow between them.

Includes Biba integrity check: sender's level must dominate receiver's.
This bakes the "no write-up" constraint into the definition, making
cap_send_requires_dominance unnecessary as an axiom.
-/
def can_communicate (s : State) (sender receiver : PluginId) : Prop :=
  -- Sender holds a capability that targets receiver with Send right AND Biba allows it
  -- With Handle/State Separation: lookup capId in kernel table
  ∃ capId ∈ (s.plugins sender).heldCaps,
    ∃ cap : Capability,
      s.kernel.revocation.caps.get? capId = some cap ∧
      cap.target = receiver ∧
      Right.Send ∈ cap.rights ∧
      (s.plugins sender).level ≥ (s.plugins receiver).level

/--
**Definition (Biba Simple Integrity)**:
A state satisfies Biba simple integrity if no information flows
from lower to higher integrity levels.
-/
def biba_simple_integrity (s : State) : Prop :=
  ∀ (writer reader : PluginId),
    writer ≠ reader →
    (s.plugins writer).level < (s.plugins reader).level →
    ¬ can_communicate s writer reader

/--
**Theorem (No Write-Up)**:
A low-integrity plugin cannot send messages to a high-integrity plugin.

This follows from the Biba constraint baked into `can_communicate`:
the definition requires sender.level ≥ receiver.level.

CONVERTED FROM AXIOM: cap_send_requires_dominance is now unnecessary
because `can_communicate` includes the level check by definition (Phase 11).
-/

  -- With Handle/State Separation: destructure with capId and cap lookup
  rcases hcomm with ⟨capId, h_held, cap, h_get, h_target, h_send, h_dom⟩
  -- h_dom : (s.plugins low).level ≥ (s.plugins high).level
  -- But h_low : (s.plugins low).level < (s.plugins high).level
  -- Contradiction
  exact (not_le_of_gt h_low) h_dom

/-! =========== PART 7: COMBINED SECURITY PROPERTY =========== -/

/--
**Definition (Noninterference: Confidentiality + Integrity)**:
Full noninterference means both:
1. High-confidentiality data doesn't leak (Noninterference.lean)
2. Low-integrity data doesn't corrupt (this file)
-/
def full_noninterference (L : SecurityLevel) (H : IntegrityLevel) : Prop :=
  -- Confidentiality: high secrets don't leak to low observers
  (∀ s1 s2, low_equivalent L s1 s2 →
    ∀ s1', Reachable s1 s1' →
    ∃ s2', Reachable s2 s2' ∧ low_equivalent L s1' s2') ∧
  -- Integrity: low-integrity inputs don't corrupt high-integrity outputs
  (∀ s1 s2, high_integrity_equiv H s1 s2 →
    ∀ s1', Reachable s1 s1' →
    ∃ s2', Reachable s2 s2' ∧ high_integrity_equiv H s1' s2')

/-! =========== SUMMARY ===========

Integrity Noninterference (Biba Dual)

This module proves that low-integrity inputs cannot affect high-integrity
outputs in the Lion microkernel:

1. Integrity Levels: Dual of security levels for confidentiality
2. H-Equivalence: States agree on high-integrity data
3. Unwinding Conditions:
   - Output Consistency: H-equiv states have H-equal outputs
   - Step Consistency: H-equiv states step to H-equiv states
   - Confinement: Low-integrity steps preserve high-integrity state
4. No Write-Up: Low-integrity cannot send to high-integrity
5. Trace NI: Full execution paths preserve integrity equivalence

Together with Confidentiality NI (Theorem 011), this provides
complete information flow security: secrets don't leak AND
trusted data isn't corrupted.
