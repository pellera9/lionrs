==============================

Capability Attenuation Algebra.

Defines authority as (target, rights) pair and proves:
1. Direct delegation attenuates authority
2. Delegation chain attenuates authority (POLA)
3. Target preservation along chains
4. Intersection (meet) cannot exceed inputs

Based on v1 Theorem 5.1 (Attenuation) and integrates with
existing Confinement.lean definitions.

# Capability Attenuation Algebra

This module defines a tiny algebra over capabilities:

* `Authority := (target, rights)`
* `≤` on authority means: same target, and rights subset
* `valid_delegation child parent` implies `child.authority ≤ parent.authority`
* `InDelegationChain caps cap root` implies `cap.authority ≤ root.authority`

This is the algebraic core used by confinement-style theorems.

We reuse the existing Confinement notions:

* `valid_delegation child parent : Prop` (already defined)
* `InDelegationChain caps cap root : Prop` (already defined)
* `confinement_chain : InDelegationChain ... -> cap.rights ⊆ root.rights` (already proven)

We add "authority" versions of those results.

### "Meet" algebra for rights (intersection)

If you "combine" two authorities by intersecting rights, the result cannot exceed either input.
(You still need the same target to compare against both sides.)

/-- If two capabilities share a target, intersecting their rights yields authority ≤ each input. -/

    (cap1 cap2 : Capability)
    (h_same_target : cap1.target = cap2.target) :

### v1 Attenuation Algebra Properties (ch4-6)

The v1 spec defines attenuation as:
  attenuate(c, constraints) = (authority_c, permissions_c ∩ new_perms,
                               constraints_c ∪ constraints, depth_c + 1)

Key properties:
  - Monotonic: authority(attenuate(c,σ)) ⊆ authority(c)
  - Transitive: attenuate(attenuate(c,σ1),σ2) = attenuate(c, σ1 ∪ σ2)

In our model, attenuation is modeled via delegation chains. The properties
are proven in terms of the Authority partial order.
-/

/--
**v1 Theorem: Attenuation Monotonicity**

Any capability derived from a parent has authority ≤ parent's authority.
This is the core POLA (Principle of Least Authority) guarantee.

v1 ch4-6 L140-141: "Monotonic: authority(attenuate(c,σ)) ⊆ authority(c)"
-/
theorem attenuation_monotonic (caps : CapTable) (child parent : Capability)
    (h_derived : DerivedFrom caps child parent) :
    child.authority ≤ parent.authority :=
  derivedFrom_reduces_authority caps child parent h_derived

/--
**v1 Theorem: Attenuation Transitivity**

If A attenuates to B, and B attenuates to C, then C's authority ≤ A's authority.
This follows from transitivity of the Authority partial order.

v1 ch4-6 L142-143: "Transitive: attenuate(attenuate(c,σ1),σ2) = attenuate(c, σ1∪σ2)"

In our model, this means: along any delegation chain, authority only decreases.
-/
theorem attenuation_transitive (a b c : Capability.Authority)
    (hab : a ≤ b) (hbc : b ≤ c) :
    a ≤ c :=
  le_trans hab hbc

/--
**v1 Theorem: Chain Attenuation**

For any delegation chain from root to descendant, the descendant's authority
is bounded by the root's authority. This is the full POLA theorem.
-/
theorem chain_attenuation (caps : CapTable) (root descendant : Capability)
    (h_wf : well_formed_table caps)
    (h_chain : InDelegationChain caps descendant root) :
    descendant.authority ≤ root.authority :=
  derived_chain_reduces_authority caps root descendant h_wf h_chain

/--
**Theorem: Attenuation Preserves Target**

Delegation cannot change the resource a capability refers to.
The target is invariant along any delegation chain.
-/
theorem attenuation_preserves_target (caps : CapTable) (root descendant : Capability)
    (h_wf : well_formed_table caps)
    (h_chain : InDelegationChain caps descendant root) :
    descendant.target = root.target :=
  delegation_chain_preserves_target caps descendant root h_wf h_chain

/--
**Theorem: Attenuation is Reflexive**

A capability's authority is ≤ itself (reflexivity of partial order).
This is the base case for chain attenuation.
-/
theorem attenuation_reflexive (auth : Capability.Authority) :
    auth ≤ auth :=
  le_refl auth

/--
**Theorem: Attenuation Antisymmetric**

If two authorities are mutually ≤, they are equal.
This ensures the authority ordering is well-defined.
-/
theorem attenuation_antisymmetric (a b : Capability.Authority)
    (hab : a ≤ b) (hba : b ≤ a) :
    a = b :=
  le_antisymm hab hba

/--
**v1 Theorem: Rights Attenuation**

Delegation can only reduce rights, never amplify them.
This is a direct corollary of valid_delegation.
-/
theorem rights_attenuation (child parent : Capability)
    (h_valid : valid_delegation child parent) :
    child.rights ⊆ parent.rights :=
  h_valid.2.1

/--
**v1 Theorem: No Authority Amplification**

A fundamental security property: there is no way to create a capability
with more authority than its parent. Combined with unforgeability,
this ensures the authority graph is monotonically decreasing.
-/
theorem no_authority_amplification (caps : CapTable) (c : Capability)
    (h_inv : table_invariant caps)
    (h_in : caps.get? c.id = some c)
    (parentId : CapId)
    (h_parent : c.parent = some parentId) :
    ∃ parent, caps.get? parentId = some parent ∧
              c.authority ≤ parent.authority := by
  obtain ⟨parent, h_parent_in, h_valid⟩ := h_inv.2 c parentId h_in h_parent
  refine ⟨parent, h_parent_in, ?_⟩
  simp only [Capability.authority, Capability.Authority.le_iff]
  exact ⟨h_valid.2.2, h_valid.2.1⟩
